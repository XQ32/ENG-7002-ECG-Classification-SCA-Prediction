# ENG 7002 | ECG Beat Classification & SCA Risk Prediction (SHHS1)

This project provides a complete MATLAB pipeline for single-lead ECG processing on SHHS1: preprocessing, Q/R/S/T delineation, beat quality assessment (SQI), feature extraction, beat classification (PVC vs Other), and SCA (sudden cardiac arrest) risk modeling based on post-PVC recovery dynamics. Interactive visualization GUIs are included.

## Internationalization Status
All source code, comments, and user-facing messages are in English as of 2025-10-08. Earlier mixed-language (Chinese/English) comments were fully translated without altering algorithmic behavior.

## 3. Quick Start (End-to-End)
```
1) Prepare data directories (see “Data Preparation”).
2) Train beat classifier: run `generate_beats_classifier.m` (or reuse `results/trainedClassifier_latest.mat`).
3) Batch prediction: run `predict_shhs1_all.m` to write `{record}_info.mat` for each EDF.
4) Train SCA risk model: run `generate_sca_classifier_v3.m` (consumes only *_info.mat).
5) Daily QC/inspection: run `view_shhs_ecg_v2.m` or `view_shhs_ecg_v3.m`.
```

## 4. Key Data Structures
```
beatInfo(i):
	.beatType          Beat label (PVC/Other; defaults to Other if no external labels)
	.segment           Beat segment waveform
	.segmentStartIndex Segment start (global sample index)
	.rIndex/qIndex/sIndex/tIndex  Indices within the segment
	.qrsOnIndex/.qrsOffIndex      QRS onset/offset (within the segment)
	.sqiIsGood/.sqiCorr/.sqiTemplateClass  SQI quality info

featureTable row:
	RR_Prev / RR_Post / R_Amplitude / Q_Amplitude / S_Amplitude / QRS_Duration / QRS_Area / BeatType
```

### 4.1 Beat-Level Features (for `generate_beats_classifier.m`)
From `extractHeartbeatFeatures` + BeatType; `trainBeatsClassifier` expects the following `RequiredVariables`.
```
Predictors (numeric):
	RR_Prev, RR_Post, R_Amplitude, Q_Amplitude, S_Amplitude, QRS_Duration, QRS_Area
Label:
	BeatType (PVC/Other)
```

### 4.2 Record-Level (Post-PVC Recovery) Features (`generate_sca_classifier_v3.m`)

This v3 script consumes only `{record}_info.mat` files and constructs post-PVC recovery dynamics features without accessing raw ECG. It operates per record as follows:

1) For each predicted PVC, build post-PVC series for RR, T-amplitude, and approximate QTc under quality gates.
2) Compute per-PVC recovery primitives (half-life, time constant, oscillation, etc.).
3) Aggregate per-PVC metrics to record-level features and add demographics if present.
4) Train an imbalance-aware binary classifier (Alive=1 / Dead=0).

Below is the complete list of record-level features exported to `results/post_ectopic_features_v3.mat` and used downstream. Names match the MATLAB struct/table fields.

#### 4.2.1 Baseline and Series Definitions

- Baseline window: `[pvcSample - baselineSec, pvcSample)` in seconds; default `baselineSec=50` s.
- Baseline RR set `baseRR_vec`: non-PVC beats with good SQI on both ends, valid RR range `[minRR, maxRR]` (default `[0.30, 2.50]` s). `muRR = mean(baseRR_vec)`, `sigRR = std(baseRR_vec)`; fallback to robust stats if too few beats (`baselineMinBeats=10`).
- Post-PVC RR series: indices after the PVC with conditions: non-PVC, good SQI on both ends, valid RR range, and within observation window up to `maxObsSec=50` s (or earlier next PVC).
- Deviation for RR: `dev_rr(t) = |RR(t) - muRR| / muRR`.
- T-amplitude baseline `muTamp`: mean absolute T amplitude within baseline if available.
- T deviation: `dev_tamp(t) = |Tamp(t) - muTamp| / muTamp` (when `muTamp > 0`).
- Approximate QTc per beat: with T-peak index `tGlobalIdx(j) > rGlobalAll(j)` and `RR(j) > 0`, approximate `QT ≈ (tGlobalIdx - rIndex)/fs + 0.5*QRS_dur(j)` and `QTc = QT / RR^(1/3)`; valid QT ∈ [0.20, 0.60] s and QTc ∈ [0.30, 0.70] s. Deviation `dev_qtc(t) = |QTc(t) - muQTc| / muQTc`, where `muQTc` is the baseline mean of valid QTc.
- HRT metrics:
	- `HRT_TO = (RR_Post1 - RR_Pre) / RR_Pre`.
	- `HRT_TS` (approximate): among the 5–15th post-PVC eligible RR intervals, take the maximum slope over any 5-consecutive RR window, i.e., `max{ (RR(i+4) - RR(i))/4 }`.

Key parameters (defaults in `generate_sca_classifier_v3.m`):
- `consecStableBeats=10` (required consecutive beats to declare stability).
- `hrt_ts_low_thr=0.0` (threshold to flag abnormally low TS).

#### 4.2.2 Per-PVC Recovery Primitives

- Half-life of RR deviation, 50%/30%/10%: first time `t` where `dev_rr ≤ {0.50, 0.30, 0.10}` holds for `consecStableBeats` consecutive points.
- Time constant of RR deviation `tau_rr`: fit `y = log(max(dev_rr, eps))` vs `t` over the first K points (K=8) by linear regression; if slope `a < 0`, `tau = -1/a`, else `NaN`.
- AUC of RR deviation `auc_rr`: trapezoidal ∫ dev_rr dt, with time normalized by `baselineSec` to reduce long-record bias (not included in final record features).
- Oscillation index `oscill_rr`: fraction of sign changes in the first difference of `dev_rr` (number of sign flips divided by number of difference steps).
- Recovery stalls `stalls_rr`: number of qualifying under-threshold segments (threshold 0.20 with length ≥ `consecStableBeats`) minus one; indicates re-instability after initial convergence (not aggregated in final features).
- Late instability variance `late_var_rr`: variance of `dev_rr` for `t ≥ 5 s` (not aggregated in final features).
- T-amplitude half-life and AUC analogous to RR (AUC not kept in final features).
- QTc half-life and AUC of `dev_qtc` (AUC kept as mean at record-level; see below).
- Coupling ratio `coupling_ratio = RR_Pre / muRR`.
- Peak HR acceleration `hr_peak_accel_bpm = max( 60/RR_Post1 - 60/muRR, 60/RR_Post2 - 60/muRR )`.
- Early/Late mean deviation of RR: early window `[0,5]` s, late window `(5,15]` s.
- Piecewise linear slopes of RR deviation: slope over `[0,5]` s and `(5,15]` s via linear fit.
- Sample entropy (RR deviation): `SampEn(m=2, r=0.2*std)` (not aggregated in final features).
- LZ complexity (RR deviation sign of first difference) (not aggregated in final features).
- Poincaré SD1/SD2 ratio: Post (≤10 s) vs Pre baseline ratio (not aggregated in final features).
- 95th percentile of RR deviation (not aggregated in final features).
- Spearman correlation between `dev_rr` and `dev_tamp` (kept as median at record-level).
- QTc overshoot fraction and magnitude: fraction where `dev_qtc > 0.10` and magnitude above 0.10 (only fraction is kept at record-level).

- `age_s1` (years): age at visit S1, truncated at 90 in the source dataset (if present in covariate CSV).

Notes:
- Some per-PVC primitives are computed but not retained at record level (e.g., `auc_rr`, `stalls_rr`, `late_var_rr`, sample entropy, LZ complexity, Poincaré ratio). They were explored and may be re-enabled for ablation/experiments.
- Default quality gates: `minPVCPerRecord=10`, `minSQIRatio=0.60` (ratio of usable non-PVC beats with good SQI); records failing gates are skipped.
- Observation window ends at the earlier of: `pvcSample + maxObsSec*fs`, next PVC sample − 1, or end of record.

Response variable: `patientVital` (1=Alive, 0=Dead).

## 5. Environment & Dependencies

- MATLAB R2021b or later recommended (uses edfread, filtfilt, movmedian, medfilt1, etc.)
- Toolboxes (recommended):
  - Signal Processing Toolbox (filters/median/SG filter)
  - Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (fitcensemble, etc.)
- Windows/macOS/Linux supported. This repo ships `mcode/` (PhysioNet WFDB MATLAB tools). The main pipeline does not strictly depend on WFDB binaries but they’re useful for extensions.

On first run, consider:

```matlab
addpath(genpath(pwd));
savepath; % optional
```

### 5.1 Optional External Tooling
- WFDB command-line tools (only needed if you extend beyond provided MATLAB m-code wrappers).
- GPU: Not required; all algorithms are CPU-based and fast for single-lead SHHS1 scale.
- Parallel Computing Toolbox: Optional for future acceleration (current scripts run single-threaded except for MATLAB's internal multithreading in vector ops).

### 5.2 Reproducibility Tips
- Fix random seed (already set in scripts: e.g., `randomSeed=42`).
- Avoid modifying generated `*_info.mat` files manually; regenerate instead.
- Maintain consistent MATLAB version across collaborators for identical floating behavior.

## 6. Data Preparation

Place the following structure under the repository root (datasets are not included in the repo):

```
shhs/
  polysomnography/
    edfs/
      shhs1/
        shhs1-XXXXXX.edf            # multiple EDFs
    annotations-rpoints/
      shhs1/
        shhs1-XXXXXX-rpoint.csv     # R-point annotations (Type/seconds/…), for supervised training
  datasets/
    shhs-cvd-summary-dataset-0.21.0.csv  # contains nsrrid and vital (0=Dead,1=Alive)
results/                               # runtime outputs (created if missing)
```

Note: SHHS1 data are typically already 60 Hz notched. Filtering defaults to `power_line_freq=0` to avoid double-notching.

Optional files:
- A blacklist CSV (e.g., `badsignallist.csv`) to exclude known low-quality or problematic records. If you use one, set its path at the top of the relevant script(s).

## 7. Generated Artifacts Overview
| Stage | Script | Key Outputs (directory) |
|-------|--------|-------------------------|
| Beat feature extraction + classifier training | `generate_beats_classifier.m` | `results/trainedClassifier_latest.mat`, `trainingFeatureTable.mat`, `testingFeatureTable.mat` |
| Batch beat prediction | `predict_shhs1_all.m` | `{record}_info.mat` (EDF folder) |
| SCA v3 feature aggregation | `generate_sca_classifier_v3.m` | `results/post_ectopic_features_v3.mat` |
| SCA model training | `generate_sca_classifier_v3.m` | `results/sca_classifier_v3.mat`, `SCA_trainingFeatureTable_v3.mat`, `SCA_testingFeatureTable_v3.mat` |
| Evaluation plots & tables | `generate_sca_classifier_v3.m` | `results/roc/*.png`, `results/pr/*.png`, calibration / decision curve PNGs, permutation & ablation CSVs |

Keep the `results/` directory under version control ignore (e.g., `.gitignore`) if storing large model artifacts externally.

## 8. How to Run

Run these in MATLAB (ideally step by step):

### 8.1 Train the Beat Classifier (PVC vs Other)

```matlab
% Adjust test split, random seed, grid search switches at the top of the script
generate_beats_classifier
```

Outputs under `results/`:
- `trainingFeatureTable.mat` / `testingFeatureTable.mat`
- `trainedClassifier_latest.mat` (and timestamped backups)

### 8.2 Batch Prediction (Generate *_info.mat)

```matlab
predict_shhs1_all
```

For each EDF, writes `{record}_info.mat` (in the same folder), containing at least:
`predPVCIndices, patientVital, fs, recordNumSamples, rGlobalAll, isPVCBeat, qrs_dur_vec, r_amp_vec, sqi_vec, t_amp_vec, tGlobalIndices`.

### 8.3 Train the SCA Risk Model (v3, *_info.mat only)

```matlab
generate_sca_classifier_v3
```

Outputs under `results/`:
- `post_ectopic_features_v3.mat`
- `SCA_trainingFeatureTable_v3.mat` / `SCA_testingFeatureTable_v3.mat`
- `sca_classifier_v3.mat`

### 8.4 Visualization (QC/Exploration)

```matlab
view_shhs_ecg_v2    % dual plots: detection markers + raw/annotations
view_shhs_ecg_v3    % integrated viewing/classification/navigation + quick SCA risk
```

## 9. Frequently Tuned Parameters (Examples)

- `ecgFilter.m`:
  - `method_index`: 1=FIR, 2=Butterworth, 3=enhanced pipeline (with QRS enhancement)
  - `power_line_freq`: 0/50/60 (SHHS1 suggests 0)
- `detectAndClassifyHeartbeats.m`:
  - Refractory, energy/slope thresholds, PVC wide-QRS adaptive windows (auto-adapts to fs)
  - Optional `assessBeatsQuality` (enabled by default)
- `assessBeatsQuality.m`:
  - `windowSec`, `bandpassHz`, `minBeatsForTemplate`, correlation thresholds, `maxShiftSec`
- `generate_beats_classifier.m`:
  - Split, blacklist, hyperparameter search, threshold moving, cost matrix
- `predict_shhs1_all.m`:
  - `pvcThresholdOverride` (higher → higher precision, lower recall)
- `generate_sca_classifier_v3.m`:
  - Recovery/baseline params, quality gates, feature selection, threshold search, cost matrix, etc.

## 10. Model Options Summary (SCA v3)
Default `modelOptions` in `generate_sca_classifier_v3.m`:

| Field | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Method | AdaBoostM1 | Candidate set: LogitBoost, GentleBoost, AdaBoostM1, RUSBoost, or 'auto' |
| NumLearningCycles | 200 | Grid may extend to 300 |
| LearnRate | 0.02 | Tuned by grid if auto selection enabled |
| MaxNumSplits | 20 | Tree depth control (affects variance) |
| MinLeafSize | 32 | Regularization (smaller = more variance) |
| NumVariablesToSample | 'sqrt' | Typical for ensemble diversity |
| enableCostMatrix | true | Class imbalance weighting (FN cost > FP) |
| costFP / costFN | 2 / 6 | Adjust to shift precision/recall trade-off |
| enableThresholdMoving | true | Post-hoc threshold search over `thrCandidates` |
| pvcThreshold | 0.21 | Updated after CV if threshold moving enabled |
| cvKFold | 10 | Stratified cross-validation folds |
| thrCandidates | 0.02:0.01:0.98 | Dense search grid for F1/Recall optimization |
| calibrationMethod | 'auto' | Chooses Platt vs isotonic based on data size |

Practical guidance:
- Increase `NumLearningCycles` + modest `LearnRate` if underfitting (flat ROC).
- Reduce `MinLeafSize` cautiously; inspect permutation importance for overfitting signals.
- Adjust `costFN` upward if Dead-class recall is clinically prioritized.
- When switching to RUSBoost, consider disabling cost matrix to avoid double compensating imbalance.

## 11. Troubleshooting (FAQ)

- Missing EDF/annotation directories: create `shhs/...` as in “Data Preparation”; scripts log missing paths.
- edfread errors or missing ECG channel: ensure the EDF exists and contains variable `ECG` (or something including `ecg/ekg`).
- Missing class during training: if one class is absent, the script falls back to equal weights; check annotations and feature filtering.
- Missing features at prediction: the script prints missing variable names; keep feature names consistent with `RequiredVariables`.
- No beats after SQI: relax correlation thresholds or `minBeatsForTemplate` in `assessBeatsQuality`.
- v3 training skips records: records must pass min PVC count and non-PVC SQI ratio gates (tune at the top of the script).
